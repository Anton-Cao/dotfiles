# DOTFILES
These dotfiles are meant to be used to bootstrap new machines. Currently, they are less featureful than my main setup, but the goal is for my main setup to eventually use these files too.

## How to use
Run `install_spacemacs.sh` to install spacemacs (first make sure Emacs v24.4+ is installed) and then run `install_dotfiles.sh` which hopefully will put the dotfiles in the correct locations.

## Applications
- [x] bash
- [x] vim
- [x] spacemacs
- [x] tmux
