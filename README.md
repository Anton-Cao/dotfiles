# DOTFILES
These dotfiles are meant to be used to bootstrap new machines. Currently, they are less featureful than my main setup, but the goal is for my main setup to eventually use these files too.

## How to use
Run `install_dotfiles.sh` which hopefully will put the dotfiles in the correct locations.
